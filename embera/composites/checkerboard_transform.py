"""
The D-Wave machine exhibits intrinsic control errors such that the effective
values of the final Hamiltonian coefficients may deviate slightly from their
programmed values.
A gauge transformation on the qubits induces a transformation on the Ising
model coefficients :math: `H_j` and :math:`J_{ij}`. One interesting property
of gauge transformations is that they transforms ferromagnetic couplings into
antiferromagnetic couplings, and vice versa. This is especially useful in
mitigating the coupler/bias leakage effect in chained qubits.
In the checkerboard transformation, the qubits on one shore of each tile are
flipped while the qubits on the other shore are unchanged. Because of the way
this pattern alternates from one unit cell to the next, this is called a
basket weave or checkerboard gauge transformation.

NOTE: To be used before wrapping the composite with EmbeddingComposite.

WARNING!: If num_reads is given in the keyed arguments (**kwargs), this is
passed unmodified to the Structured Sampler for every gauge.
i.e. If num_reads=1000 then there will be 4000 samples.

The gauge transformations are performed sequentially:
     I: Identity transformation     (no spins flipped)
     G: Checkered transformation    (spins flipped starting with shore 0)
    -I: Inverse transformation      (spins flipped starting with shore 1)
    -G: Checkered transformation    (spins flipped starting with shore 0)
